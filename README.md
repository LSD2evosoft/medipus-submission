# Medipus - Hack & Heal submission

## Introduction

Hi! We are a team of 4 engineers from evosoft Hungary:

- **L**illa Juhász
- **S**oma Zsják
- **D**ániel Vidó
- **D**ávid Vadászi

Together we formed LSD², to have fun solving medical related challenges in a much-much more agile way than we usually do!

## Chosen challenge

We have chosen the MSD challenge, to develop an online platform which helps individuals understand the importance of early screening and helps them conveniently get screened in the state healthcare system.

## Solution

During a challenge we will develop a web based solution, that will

- Help ease users into participating prevention rather than treatment
- Give them the nudge when they need it the most
- Provide useful information in a human-digestable way

Other than providing a working prototype, we will explore the possibilities of integrating with existing healthcare systems as well as ways to deliver our content to the target audience.
